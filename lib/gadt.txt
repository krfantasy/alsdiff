**Analyzing OCaml GADTs**

I'm beginning to break down the user's request, focusing on understanding Generalized Algebraic Data Types (GADTs) in OCaml. The user seems a bit puzzled, so I'm aiming for a clear, concise explanation, probably starting with simple examples. I'll need to remember to touch on their specific advantages as well as some of the more confusing aspects.


**Exploring GADT Construction**

I'm now zeroing in on practical examples to illustrate GADT construction. The regular ADT comparison highlights how GADTs offer more fine-grained type control. I'm thinking of a scenario where type safety is paramount, perhaps a simple expression evaluator. The user's confusion indicates I should emphasize the 'why' behind using GADTs, focusing on advantages like compile-time error detection.


**Refining the Explanation**

I'm now iterating on the "typed value" example. To make it more concrete, I'll add a function that *uses* the typed value: something that takes a `_ value` and returns something based on the type. I think that'll help solidify the concept. Maybe something that converts to a string. I am getting closer to the user's need.


**Elaborating the Typed Value**

I'm now focusing on a complete example using the "typed value" GADT. I will introduce a `to_string` function demonstrating the core benefit: compile-time type safety through pattern matching. The `to_string` function will show how the compiler refines the types within each pattern-match branch, letting you work with specific types without type casts or other awkwardness.


**Constructing a Clearer Example**

I'm now focusing on a more real-world example. It will involve creating a little data structure and corresponding methods to make the concept even more clear. This should make it easy to follow the explanation.


**Revising Example Clarity**

I've been working on a better illustration of GADTs in OCaml, focusing on a clear, real-world example. I'm aiming for an expression evaluator, as that is a more familiar context. I'll need to define some supporting data structures and methods to reinforce the key concepts without overcomplicating things.



```

Of course. Let's skip the jargon and focus on the core idea.

Think of a regular algebraic data type (ADT) as a box that can hold different kinds of items, but the label on the outside of the box is always the same.

```ocaml
(* Regular ADT *)
type 'a An_adt =
  | IntVal of int
  | StrVal of string
```

If you have a value of type `int an_adt`, you don't know if it was made with `IntVal` or `StrVal`. The type system loses that information.

---

A **GADT** is like a collection of special boxes. The shape of the box (the constructor you use) tells you *exactly* what's inside. The type becomes more specific.

Here is the key difference: **with a GADT, the constructor defines the final type.**

### A Simple Example

Let's define a type that can hold *either* an `int` or a `string`, but we want the type system to remember which one.

```ocaml
(* GADT *)
type _ typed_value =
  | Int : int -> int typed_value
  | String : string -> string typed_value

(* Let's create some values *)
let v1 = Int 10         (* v1 has type int typed_value *)
let v2 = String "hello" (* v2 has type string typed_value *)
```

Notice `v1` and `v2` have *different* types (`int typed_value` vs `string typed_value`), even though they belong to the same type family `typed_value`.

### The Payoff: Pattern Matching

This becomes powerful inside functions. When you pattern match, OCaml restores the specific type information for you within each branch.

```ocaml
let to_string (v : 'a typed_value) : string =
  match v with
  | Int i ->
      (* In this branch, OCaml knows 'a is int. *)
      (* So it knows `i` is an int. *)
      "The int is " ^ (string_of_int i)
  | String s ->
      (* In this branch, OCaml knows 'a is string. *)
      (* So it knows `s` is a string. *)
      "The string is " ^ s
```

### The Classic Use Case: A Type-Safe Evaluator

This allows you to build things that are impossible to represent incorrectly. For example, a typed expression language.

```ocaml
type _ expr =
  | Int : int -> int expr
  | Bool : bool -> bool expr
  | Add : (int expr * int expr) -> int expr
  | Eq : ('a expr * 'a expr) -> bool expr (* Note the 'a here! *)

let rec eval : type a. a expr -> a = function
  | Int i -> i
  | Bool b -> b
  | Add (x, y) -> (eval x) + (eval y)
  | Eq (x, y) -> (eval x) = (eval y)
```
The compiler can prove that `eval` always returns the correct type. You could not even construct an invalid expression like `Add (Int 5, Bool true)`.

### Summary

*   **Regular ADT**: The type parameter applies to the whole type.
*   **GADT**: The constructor specifies the exact instantiation of the type parameter.
*   **Benefit**: Pattern matching recovers this specific type, enabling much safer code.

# Q: I don't see any difference between `an_adt` vs `typed_value`

# A:
``` reasoning
**Understanding the Core Issue**

I've identified the key point of confusion: the user is misinterpreting the role of the "of" keyword in the examples. They're likely focusing on the data type declarations (`of int`, `of string`) rather than the underlying differences between `an_adt` and `typed_value`. My focus is now on clarifying this crucial distinction.


**Refining the Explanation**

I'm now focusing on a concrete example to highlight the distinction. I've formulated the "Identity Function Problem," demonstrating how a function working with the GADT is straightforward. I'm exploring how the ADT version is more complicated, requiring pattern matching to recover the specific type, and I'll use that to drive home the key difference between both.


**Developing a Clear Demonstration**

I'm solidifying the identity function example. The ADT version will need complex pattern-matching to resolve the type, whereas the GADT version naturally works. This should underscore the crucial type distinction.


**Focusing on the Key Difference**

I'm now zeroing in on a critical point: the user's perception that both `an_adt` and `typed_value` are equivalent because they can hold ints or strings. I'll highlight the difference in *how the type system interprets* each case. My next step involves constructing a clear example to demonstrate this distinction, which will show why one version type-checks seamlessly, and the other does not.


**Developing the Core Analogy**

I am now focusing on the "Identity Function Problem" to showcase the type system behavior disparity. With the GADT, defining a function to return the same type is simple and type-safe. In contrast, the standard ADT version faces a contradiction in type signatures, preventing it from functioning as intended. This side-by-side comparison should be crucial to highlighting the key difference.



```

You are right, they look similar. The difference is subtle but crucial. It's not about *what* they hold, but about what the **type system knows** after you create a value.

Let's look at the types of the created values:

```ocaml
(* Regular ADT *)
type 'a an_adt =
  | IntVal of int
  | StrVal of string

let v_adt = IntVal 10 (* The type of v_adt is 'a an_adt. The 'a is unknown! *)
```

With `an_adt`, the type parameter `'a` is a placeholder for the *entire type*. When you create `IntVal 10`, the compiler only knows you have *some* `an_adt`. It has lost the information that it was made with an `int`.

---

```ocaml
(* GADT *)
type _ typed_value =
  | Int : int -> int typed_value
  | String : string -> string typed_value

let v_gadt = Int 10 (* The type of v_gadt is int typed_value. It is specific! *)
```

With `typed_value`, the constructor **fixes** the type parameter. The compiler knows `v_gadt` is not just *any* `typed_value`, it is specifically an `int typed_value`.

### The "Impossible Function" Test

This difference becomes clear when you try to write a function that returns the inner value.

**With GADT, this is easy and type-safe:**

```ocaml
let get_value (v : 'a typed_value) : 'a =
  match v with
  | Int i -> i      (* Here, compiler knows 'a = int. Returns int. Correct. *)
  | String s -> s  (* Here, compiler knows 'a = string. Returns string. Correct. *)
```
This code works perfectly.

**With the regular ADT, this is impossible:**

```ocaml
let get_value_adt (v : 'a an_adt) : 'a =
  match v with
  | IntVal i -> i    (* Error: This branch returns int. So 'a must be int. *)
  | StrVal s -> s    (* Error: This branch returns string. But we already decided 'a is int! *)
```
This function will not compile. The compiler complains because the function must return a single type `'a`, but the branches return different types (`int` and `string`). The type `'a` cannot be both at once.

### Summary

-   `an_adt`: `IntVal 10` produces a value of a **generic** type `'a an_adt`.
-   `typed_value`: `Int 10` produces a value of a **specific** type `int typed_value`.

The GADT embeds type information into the value itself, which the compiler can then use.

# Q: OK. Now I start understand a little bit about GADT. here is my code, the compiler complains about `read_element_name`, `read_index` and `read_attrs` return different types, can I use GADT to solve this problem?

```ocaml
let read_element_name (s : string) (idx : int) : int * string =
  read_something (fun ch -> ch = '/' || ch = '@' || ch = '[') s idx

let read_index (s : string) (idx : int) : int * int =
  let intmd = read_something (fun ch -> ch = ']') s idx in
  (fst intmd, int_of_string @@ snd intmd)

let read_attrs (s : string) (idx : int) : int * string list =
  let intmd = read_something (fun ch -> ch = '/' || ch = '[') s idx in
  (fst intmd, String.split_on_char '@' @@ snd intmd)

let build_element_queries s =
  let rec parse idx acc =
    let (idx, result) =
      (match s.[idx] with
       | 'A'..'Z' | 'a'..'z' -> read_element_name s idx
       | '[' -> read_index s idx
       | '@' -> read_attrs s idx
       | _ -> failwith "Invalid character") in
    if idx >= String.length s then
      List.rev acc
    else
      parse idx (result :: acc)
  in
  parse 0 []
```

# A:
``` reasoning
**Exploring User Needs**

I've been examining the user's issue with `read_element_name`, `read_index`, and `read_attrs`. These functions currently take `string` and `int` arguments. I'm focusing on the user's use case to better understand how we can leverage GADTs effectively. I'm exploring the problem's scope and identifying the specific functions in the user's code.


**Refining the GADT Approach**

I'm now focusing on constructing a unified type to represent the various return types of `read_element_name`, `read_index`, and `read_attrs`.  The challenge lies in defining a GADT that preserves type information, allowing for heterogeneous results within the `build_element_queries` function.  I'm envisioning a structure where each variant of the GADT encapsulates a specific return type, enabling type-safe matching and manipulation of the diverse results.


**Developing a Unified Type**

I'm now focusing on creating a `query_part` GADT to represent the return types.  I've defined `ElementName`, `Index`, and `Attrs` constructors, each representing a specific result type (`string`, `int`, `string list`). The goal is to  refactor `build_element_queries` to use this new GADT for type-safe handling of heterogeneous results. My focus now is on integrating this into the existing code with a concrete example.


**Adapting the Wrapper Approach**

I've realized that the initial GADT design won't work directly within the list. I'm focusing on wrapping the GADT within a regular ADT. This wrapper will allow me to store different query parts in a list while preserving type information through pattern matching. The plan is to define this wrapper and integrate it into `build_element_queries` for type-safe handling of heterogeneous results.


**Developing the Wrapper**

I've realized the core issue is not fully understanding how to best use the GADT in `build_element_queries`. I'm now focused on refactoring the problematic  `let (idx, result) = ...` line. The goal is to pattern match on the wrapped `any_query_part` to extract the correct return type.  My current aim is to demonstrate a type-safe and functional `build_element_queries` implementation.


**Finalizing Implementation Steps**

I'm now fully immersed in the coding phase, tackling the remaining steps to implement the GADT solution. First, I'll modify the `read_*` functions to return the new `any_query_part` type. I'll then refactor the `build_element_queries` function to accommodate the changes. Finally, I'll demonstrate how the user can "unwrap" the results.


**Developing the Final Solution**

I'm now implementing the `to_string` function to demonstrate how to unwrap results. This function will pattern match on the `Any` and GADT constructors to format the output safely. This is my last crucial step, ensuring I can demonstrate how the GADT-based solution addresses the user's need for type-safe handling of heterogeneous results.


**Developing the Solution's Structure**

I'm now focusing on integrating the `to_string` function to extract values safely. My plan is to start with the `build_element_queries` implementation, including type annotations for clarity. This approach will allow us to showcase the value of the GADT-based solution. My aim is to demonstrate a working example that the user can readily adapt.

\n\n**Presenting the Final Implementation**

I've crafted a comprehensive example demonstrating the GADT-based solution. The code showcases `read_*` functions, the crucial `build_element_queries`, and the `to_string` function. This approach successfully addresses the heterogeneous result issue, ensuring type-safe manipulation of results. The user now has a clear and executable demonstration of how to implement the GADT approach for their use case.



```

Yes, absolutely. This is a perfect use case for a GADT.

The problem is that your `match` statement needs to return a single, consistent type, but your `read_*` functions return different types: `int * string`, `int * int`, and `int * string list`.

We can use a GADT to create a new, unified type that can represent any of these results.

### 1. Define the GADT

First, we define a GADT `query_part` to represent the different kinds of data you can parse. We also define a wrapper type `any_query_part` so we can store these different types in the same list.

```ocaml
(* The GADT defines a "family" of related types *)
type _ query_part =
  | ElementName : string -> string query_part
  | Index : int -> int query_part
  | Attrs : string list -> string list query_part

(* This wrapper lets us put different 'query_part's in one list *)
type any_query_part =
  | Any : 'a query_part -> any_query_part
```

### 2. Update the `read_*` Functions

Now, modify your `read_*` functions to return this new type instead of a tuple. They will now all return the same type: `int * any_query_part`.

```ocaml
let read_element_name (s : string) (idx : int) : int * any_query_part =
  let new_idx, name = read_something (fun ch -> ch = '/' || ch = '@' || ch = '[') s idx in
  (new_idx, Any (ElementName name))

let read_index (s : string) (idx : int) : int * any_query_part =
  let new_idx, str_val = read_something (fun ch -> ch = ']') s idx in
  (new_idx, Any (Index (int_of_string str_val)))

let read_attrs (s : string) (idx : int) : int * any_query_part =
  let new_idx, str_val = read_something (fun ch -> ch = '/' || ch = '[') s idx in
  (new_idx, Any (Attrs (String.split_on_char '@' str_val)))
```

### 3. Fix `build_element_queries`

Your main function now works without any changes to its logic, because every branch of the `match` statement returns the same `int * any_query_part` type. The return type of the whole function becomes `any_query_part list`.

```ocaml
let build_element_queries s : any_query_part list =
  let rec parse idx acc =
    if idx >= String.length s then
      List.rev acc
    else
      let (idx, result) =
        (match s.[idx] with
        | 'A' .. 'Z' | 'a' .. 'z' -> read_element_name s idx
        | '[' -> read_index s (idx + 1) (* Skip '[' *)
        | '@' -> read_attrs s (idx + 1) (* Skip '@' *)
        | _ -> failwith "Invalid character")
      in
      parse idx (result :: acc)
  in
  parse 0 []
```

### The Payoff: Using the Result

The real power shows when you use the result. Pattern matching on the GADT restores the original type information in each branch, so you can safely work with the inner value.

```ocaml
let part_to_string (p : any_query_part) : string =
  match p with
  | Any (ElementName s) -> "Element(" ^ s ^ ")"
  | Any (Index i) -> "Index(" ^ (string_of_int i) ^ ")"
  | Any (Attrs lst) -> "Attrs(" ^ (String.concat ", " lst) ^ ")"

(* Example usage: *)
let my_queries = build_element_queries "element[123]@attr1@attr2"
(* val my_queries : any_query_part list =
   [Any (ElementName "element"); Any (Index 123); Any (Attrs ["attr1"; "attr2"])] *)

let () = List.iter (fun p -> print_endline (part_to_string p)) my_queries
(*
  Prints:
  Element(element)
  Index(123)
  Attrs(attr1, attr2)
*)
```

By using a GADT, you solved the compiler error and made your program more type-safe and easier to understand.

# Q: Can you got rid of the type `any_query_part`?

# A:
``` reasoning
**Investigating Removal Strategy**

I'm starting to analyze the user's request, focusing on "getting rid of `any_query_part`."  It seems like they understand the proposed solution. I am now exploring potential follow-up questions to understand the nuances of this desire, and how it aligns with the overall design goals. It should provide insight into the user's ultimate objective.


**Exploring Alternative Approaches**

I've been examining the rationale behind `any_query_part`. Initially, it seemed a direct solution for heterogeneous list creation. I'm now delving into the role of GADTs, focusing on the homogeneity constraint of OCaml lists. I'm considering if the GADT design inherently necessitates this "existential wrapper" or if other strategies might be viable to achieve the same result. The box analogy is proving helpful for my ongoing assessment of the design's effectiveness.


**Justifying the Necessity**

I'm now grappling with the user's apparent desire to eliminate `any_query_part`. I'm focusing on the technical reasons why it is essential for heterogeneous data representation within a homogenous list. The core issue is the fundamental type constraints of OCaml lists, preventing direct storage of differing GADT constructors. I'm building a concise argument explaining the necessity of `any_query_part` to meet these constraints, emphasizing the role it plays in achieving type safety. I'm striving for clarity and precision in this next phase of the reasoning.


**Defending the Existential Wrapper**

I'm now fully immersed in constructing a robust response to the user's inquiry regarding `any_query_part`. I need to firmly defend its presence. I'll begin with a direct "no" and then explain, using the box analogy, how it provides a standard container solution. I will also make clear why the current design, including the existential wrapper, is necessary for maintaining OCaml list type safety while accommodating the user's heterogeneous data.


**Formulating a Definitive Rebuttal**

I'm now crafting a direct response to the user's question about eliminating `any_query_part`. I plan to start with a firm "no" to immediately address their concern. Then, I'll explain the fundamental need for the existential wrapper, emphasizing OCaml's type constraints. The box analogy will aid in making this concept more accessible. I'll also explore alternative data structures, offering the user a more comprehensive understanding.



```

Excellent question. The direct answer is: **No, you cannot get rid of `any_query_part` if you want to store the results in a standard OCaml `list`.**

Here is the fundamental reason:

An OCaml list must be **homogeneous**. Every single element in a `'a list` must have the exact same type `'a`.

Let's look at the types our GADT constructors create:
- `ElementName "hello"` has type `string query_part`.
- `Index 123` has type `int query_part`.
- `Attrs ["a"]` has type `string list query_part`.

These are three **different, incompatible types**. You cannot put them in the same list. The compiler would stop you:

```ocaml
(* This code will NOT compile *)
let my_list = [ ElementName "a"; Index 1 ]
(*
Error: This expression has type int query_part
       but an expression was expected of type string query_part
*)
```

### The Role of `any_query_part`

The `any_query_part` type is an **existential wrapper**. Its only job is to solve this exact problem. It takes a value of *any* `_ query_part` type and wraps it in a single, concrete, uniform type: `any_query_part`.

- `Any (ElementName "a")` has type `any_query_part`.
- `Any (Index 1)` has type `any_query_part`.

Now all the elements have the same outer type, and they can be stored in a `any_query_part list`. When you pattern match, you unwrap the `Any` constructor and the GADT machinery gives you back the original specific type.

### Alternative (Advanced)

Could you create a data structure that *is* heterogeneous? Yes. This is called a heterogeneous list (or HList), but you have to build it yourself and it's much more complex to work with. It's generally not what you want unless you have very specific needs.

For almost all practical purposes, the **GADT + Existential Wrapper** pattern is the standard, idiomatic, and correct way to solve this problem in OCaml.

# Q: OK. Does GADT introduces some performance overhead in runtime? or its a pure compilation stage thing?

# A:
``` reasoning
**Evaluating the Question's Core**

I'm focusing on the user's query about GADT's runtime impact. My main question is whether it's a zero-cost abstraction. My initial thoughts revolved around static typing and how it could influence performance.


**Refining the Runtime Costs**

I've been drilling down on the existential wrapper's implications. While GADTs themselves are generally compile-time, the `any_query_part` wrapper is a potential performance bottleneck. I need to quantify this cost to give a comprehensive answer. I'm considering scenarios where the wrapper becomes a performance drain.


**Exploring Cost-Benefit Analysis**

I'm now focusing on the performance trade-offs. The existential wrapper adds indirection, so I'm investigating real-world scenarios where this could become noticeable. My goal is a nuanced response, acknowledging the wrapper's cost while emphasizing GADTs' type-safety advantages. I'm building concrete examples to illustrate the balance between runtime overhead and code clarity.


**Delving Into Performance Comparisons**

I'm now comparing the GADT approach with alternatives, focusing on the allocation and indirection introduced by the wrapper. I'm building a simple benchmark to quantify the overhead. My aim is to determine if the benefits of type-safety are truly worth the small runtime cost. I'll include benchmarks showing a pattern match in each version, and determine the difference.


**Summarizing the Core Points**

I've clarified the core idea: GADTs themselves are a compile-time construct that can improve performance. I've also carefully explained how the `any_query_part` wrapper introduces minimal overhead. My response will highlight the type safety benefits, despite the minor indirection cost. The existing example code is key to understanding the performance trade-offs. I'm building a simple benchmark to quantify the costs more specifically.


**Evaluating Performance Trade-offs**

I've been meticulously analyzing the performance of the existential wrapper, recognizing it as the central point. I'm building a concise explanation, emphasizing that GADTs are largely compile-time but acknowledge the wrapper's impact. The focus is on a fair comparison between the GADT solution with the wrapper and a regular ADT approach. I'm focusing on allocation and indirection introduced by the wrapper.



```

Excellent question. It's almost entirely a **compile-time feature**.

In many cases, GADTs can lead to **better runtime performance** because they allow the compiler to generate more specialized and efficient code.

### GADTs Themselves: Zero Overhead

When you use a GADT where the type is fully known at the call site (like the type-safe `eval` example from earlier), there is no runtime overhead. The compiler uses the static type information to eliminate branches and checks, producing very direct code.

```ocaml
(* from earlier *)
let rec eval : type a. a expr -> a = function ...
```
When compiling `eval (Add (Int 5, Int 10))`, the compiler *knows* the result is an `int` and can generate code equivalent to `(eval (Int 5)) + (eval (Int 10))`, which is essentially just `5 + 10`. There are no runtime type checks.

### The Wrapper Pattern: Minimal Overhead

In our specific `build_element_queries` example, the performance cost does not come from the GADT itself, but from the **existential wrapper** (`Any`) that we needed to put different types into a list.

This wrapper introduces a tiny, predictable overhead:
1.  **One extra allocation:** Creating `Any (ElementName s)` allocates a small block of memory for the `ElementName` constructor, and another small block for the `Any` constructor which just points to the first block.
2.  **One extra indirection:** When you pattern match, the code has to "look inside" the `Any` wrapper to get to the real GADT constructor.

However, this is **exactly the same overhead** you would have with a regular ADT to solve the same problem:

```ocaml
(* Regular ADT for comparison *)
type query_part_regular =
  | ElementName of string
  | Index of int
  | Attrs of string list
```

The memory layout and access pattern for `query_part_regular` is virtually identical to our `any_query_part`.

### Conclusion

-   **GADT is a compile-time tool.** It gives information to the type checker.
-   It **does not** inherently introduce runtime overhead.
-   The small overhead in our example comes from the **data structure pattern** (an existential wrapper for a list), which would be necessary even with a regular ADT.

You are paying a very small, constant performance price for the ability to store heterogeneous data, and the GADT gives you vastly superior type safety for that same price.

**Framing the Comparison**

I'm now zeroing in on deconstructing the user's request. It's clear they want a comparison of variants, GADTs, and polymorphic variants. Currently, my focus is on identifying the specific aspects that *need* to be compared. I'm thinking of drawing up a table with characteristics to make it easy to compare the features later.


**Clarifying the Core Aspects**

I've been drilling down on the user's need for comparison. I'm prioritizing the "When should I use which?" aspect, recognizing that's the core question. To make the comparison effective, I'm thinking of building a table contrasting the features: how they are declared, what they are used for, strengths, and weaknesses. This approach should offer a focused, helpful understanding.


**Structuring the Comparison**

I'm now outlining a detailed comparison table. The columns will be dedicated to Variants, GADTs, and Polymorphic Variants, while the rows will cover the declaration syntax, core concepts, type system characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, and potential use cases. I think this approach offers a clear and structured way to answer the user's question about when to use which feature effectively.


**Outlining the Core Table**

I'm now making a draft of the comparison table's core structure. I'll include rows for the features, the syntax, and their key ideas. Next up is fleshing out each cell with more details on how these types relate. This will assist the user with understanding the distinctions.


**Refining the Core Concepts**

I'm now diving deeper into the nuances of each type. Specifically, I'm focusing on "Key Idea" and "Type Parameters." For ADTs, I'm refining how to express the fixed-set nature. For GADTs, I'm clarifying how constructors refine the type. Finally, for polymorphic variants, I'm working to articulate that the focus is on the tags, not a fixed structure. This focused effort will help the user grasp these central ideas.


**Refining the "When to Use" Section**

I'm now putting the finishing touches on the "When to Use" section. I'm prioritizing clear, concise examples for each feature. For ADTs, I'll emphasize their use as the default for modeling a closed set of cases. For GADTs, I'll solidify the example of the type-safe evaluator to showcase type-level programming. Finally, for polymorphic variants, I'll work out a clear example demonstrating flexible error handling in a scenario where you're combining functions from multiple libraries without a shared type.


**Synthesizing the Explanation**

I've finalized the comparison table and the "When to Use" section. I've ensured concise examples and prioritized clarity. The explanation is now ready. I've also focused on directness, ensuring the response answers the user's questions in a clear and helpful way.



```

Of course. This is a great question that gets to the heart of OCaml's type system.

Here's a comparison, starting with a summary table and then explaining when to use each.

### Comparison Table

| Feature                  | Variants (ADT)                                      | GADTs                                                 | Polymorphic Variants                                  |

| **Declaration**          | `type t = A of int`                                 | `type _ t = A : int -> int t`                         | No single definition. Used directly: `` `A ``          |
| **Core Idea**            | A type with a fixed, closed set of constructors.    | A type where constructors refine the type parameters. | Anonymous, structural tags that aren't tied to a type. |
| **Type System**          | **Nominal:** A type is defined by its name.         | **Nominal:** A type is defined by its name.           | **Structural:** A type is defined by its shape/tags.  |
| **Extensibility**        | **Closed:** All constructors are defined at once.   | **Closed:** All constructors are defined at once.     | **Open:** You can introduce new tags anywhere.         |
| **Pattern Matching**     | The compiler warns if you miss a case.              | The compiler warns if you miss a case.                | The compiler warns if you don't handle a case.        |
| **Main Advantage**       | Simplicity, clarity, and compile-time completeness. | Proving invariants and relationships in the type system. | Flexibility, extensibility, and composability.        |
| **Classic Use Case**     | Modeling data: `option`, `list`, `tree`.            | Type-safe interpreters, DSLs, state machines.       | Flexible error handling, combining disparate modules.  |

### When to Use Which

#### 1. Use Variants (ADTs) by Default

This is your standard, go-to tool for about 90% of cases.

**Use it when:**
*   You have a well-defined, fixed set of possibilities for a piece of data.
*   You want the compiler to guarantee that you have handled every possible case.

**Example:** Modeling a traffic light. The states are fixed and known.

```ocaml
type traffic_light = Red | Yellow | Green

let action_for light =
  match light with
  | Red -> "Stop"
  | Yellow -> "Prepare to stop"
  | Green -> "Go"
(* The compiler will warn you if you forget a color. *)
```

#### 2. Use GADTs for Proofs

Use a GADT when the *type* of a value depends on *how it was constructed*. This allows you to encode complex rules into the type system, making invalid states unrepresentable.

**Use it when:**
*   You are building a type-safe interpreter or Domain-Specific Language (DSL).
*   You need to prove relationships between different values at compile time.

**Example:** The type-safe expression evaluator we discussed. It's impossible to construct an invalid expression like `Add (Int 5, Bool true)`.

```ocaml
type _ expr =
  | Int : int -> int expr
  | Add : (int expr * int expr) -> int expr

(* This function is guaranteed by the types to only add integers. *)
let eval (e : int expr) : int = ...
```

#### 3. Use Polymorphic Variants for Flexibility

Use polymorphic variants when you need to break free from the "closed world" of regular variants. They are defined by their structure, not a central `type` definition.

**Use it when:**
*   **Flexible Error Handling:** A function can state it returns a *subset* of possible errors, and the caller can handle them without knowing about all possible errors in the whole program.
*   **Combining Code:** You need to combine functions from different modules or libraries that were not designed to work together, but happen to share some common cases (e.g., they both use `` `Error ``).

**Example:** A function that might fail in one of two ways. Notice there is no `type error = ...` definition.

```ocaml
let find_user id : (string, [> `NotFound | `PermissionDenied ]) result =
  if id = 0 then Error `NotFound
  else if id = 1 then Error `PermissionDenied
  else Ok "Alice"

(* The caller can handle just the cases it cares about. *)
let display_user id =
  match find_user id with
  | Ok name -> "User: " ^ name
  | Error `NotFound -> "Could not find user."
  | Error `PermissionDenied -> "You can't see this user."
(* The [>] indicates this function can be used where a wider set
   of errors is expected, e.g., `[> `NotFound | `PermissionDenied | `DatabaseDown ]` *)
```

**In short:** Start with **variants**. Reach for **GADTs** when you need compile-time proofs. Use **polymorphic variants** when you need extensibility and to decouple parts of your system.
